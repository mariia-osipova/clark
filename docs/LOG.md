## 2026-03-27 — Juan — Catalog scraper and embedding index implemented

**Type:** catalog

Created `scripts/scrape_catalog.py`: paginates Carrefour Argentina VTEX API, normalizes products to the supershop schema (id, name, brand, package_size, price, list_price, discount_pct, offer_label, image_url, available_quantity, category), and writes `data/catalog_snapshot.json`. Updated `build_index()` in `backend/product_semantic_index.py` to generate per-product embeddings via `text-embedding-3-small` (batched, 512/call) and persist them in `data/product_semantic_index.json`. Run with `python scripts/scrape_catalog.py`; use `--skip-index` to skip the embedding step, `--max-products N` for quick test runs.
